        lives. During lockdown many people managed to find new ways to keep themselves busy. Some of the things that people did was streaming videos and movies, exercising at home, shopping online, and ordering take-out on popular delivery apps.

          <figcaption class="graphic-text">Another thing that people did during the lockdown was a lot of online shopping. During the lockdown, many people turned to online shopping companies such as Amazon. Amazon was able to grow its net worth and
            revenue through the rise in online shopping during the lockdown. Throughout the start of Quarter 2 in 2020, there was an increase in the number of books that people were buying. Part of the reason people bought more books was to keep
            themselves entertained. In addition, there was a 183% rise in buying entertainment

          <img src="images/workout.png">
          <figcaption class="graphic-text"> One of the things that people did during the lockdown was home workouts using various fitness apps. There was an increase in app downloads during the lockdown from Quarter 1 to Quarter 2. During Quarter 1
            and Quarter 2, the U.S.’s app downloads grew 21%. There was record downloads for apps during the month of April, such as the popular app, Strava.

          <h4>Video Streaming</h4>
          <img src="images/videostream.png">
          <figcaption class="graphic-text">Popular online streaming companies also increased its numbers during the lockdown. These companies included Amazon Prime and Netflix. Amazon Prime, during this time, was able to increase the number of
            subscribers. In Quarter 2, Amazon accounted for roughly 23% of all streaming-video on demand services. Netflix on the other hand, was able to add roughly 16 million new subscribers within the first quarter of 2020. Netflix now has a total

          <h4>Online Food Delivery</h4>
          <img src="images/fooddeliv.png">
          <figcaption class="graphic-text">Online food shopping also increased during the pandemic lockdown. During this time, Uber rides went down because the lockdown forced everyone to stay indoors. However, Uber Eats took over as the top
            earner
            for Uber during Quarter 2. In addition, Doordash, another popular online food delivery app, was able to gain numbers as well. During the lockdown, many restaurants relied heavily on delivery apps just to stay afloat when people
            weren’t
            allowed to dine in. For many restaurants, these apps, along with Grubhub, were the only source of revenue. </figcaption>
